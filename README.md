Introduction
------------
This GitHub account has a collection of repositories used for shared revision resources. Users can upload and edit notes, cheatsheets, links, etc. to help others. There is a different repository for each module. If you don't know how to use `git`, please read my tutorial [here][tutorial-link]. 

The Idea
--------
Sharing notes, solutions, and other resources is usually done by posting on social media groups, using Google Docs, or other cumbersome ways. 

My idea is to have a central location for the resources for a particular module. This way, the resources are kept organised and they can continue growing.

Expanding on this idea, I thought it would be useful to have a set of resources that can be edited by anyone. This way, typos, missing information, etc., can be corrected by anyone, and then the administrator can publish these changes to all other users.

By using git, these is achieved.

Modules
-------
- Year 1
	- [Algebra and Combinatorics](https://github.com/UoB-Mathematics/Year-1-AC)
	- [Probability and Statistics](https://github.com/UoB-Mathematics/Year-1-PS)
- Year 2
	- [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/UoB-Mathematics/Year-2-LA)
	- [Multivariable and Vector Analysis](https://github.com/UoB-Mathematics/2-MVA)

Contributing
------------
If you wish to contribute to a particular module: 

1. Fork the repository for the module.
2. Clone your forked repository.
3. Create a new branch
4. Make your changes.
5. Sync your local repository with the remote.
6. Submit a pull request to the original repository on a new branch.
	
What if I can't figure out how to use git?
------------------------------------------
If you have read through the [tutorial][tutorial-link], but it isn't making sense, you can post your changes/resources on the Facebook group, or you can email [UoBMathsGithub@googlemail.com](mailto:UoBMathsGithub@googlemail.com) and an owner of the repository will try to include them.
